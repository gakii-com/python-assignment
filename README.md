# 🧮 Basic Arithmetic Operations in Python

This is a simple Python program that takes **two numbers** as input and performs **all basic arithmetic operations** on them. It’s beginner-friendly and easy to run from the terminal.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Addition
- ✅ Subtraction
- ✅ Multiplication
- ✅ Division (with zero-check)
- ✅ Modulus (with zero-check)
- ✅ Floor Division (with zero-check)
- ✅ Exponentiation

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input **two numbers**.
2. The program performs:
   - ➕ Addition
   - ➖ Subtraction
   - ✖️ Multiplication
   - ➗ Division
   - 🪙 Modulus
   - 🧱 Floor Division
   - 🧠 Exponentiation
3. Division-related operations are safely handled to avoid division by zero errors.

## 📷 Sample Output
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 3

Results for numbers 10.0 and 3.0:

Addition (+): 13.0
Subtraction (-): 7.0
Multiplication (*): 30.0
Division (/): 3.3333333333333335
Modulus (%): 1.0
Floor Division (//): 3.0
Exponentiation (**): 1000.0
